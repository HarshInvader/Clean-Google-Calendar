To be used with the Stylish browser extension on Google Chrome.

May also work on other browsers with Stylish but has not been tested extensively anywhere but Chrome.

Works nicely when you create a Chrome desktop link and tell it to treat it natively (launches Chrome with no tab or address bar, so it looks like a native calendar app).

If you find any bugs or weird things please send me a message and I'll fix them.

Hope you enjoy it.
